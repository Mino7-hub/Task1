    <section class="review-content">
        <h2>Storyline & Narrative: 8/10</h2>
        <p>Cyberpunk 2077 offers a bold narrative set in the dystopian future of **Night City**, a sprawling urban jungle filled with danger, corruption, and intrigue. You play as **V**, a mercenary caught in a web of conspiracies, and your story is shaped by the choices you make, including aligning with different factions, making moral decisions, and experiencing a range of character-driven subplots.</p>

        <p>The main storyline revolves around V's quest to survive the deadly **biochip** that is slowly taking over their mind, with the ghost of **Johnny Silverhand**, played by **Keanu Reeves**, taking up residence in their head. The relationship between V and Johnny is a compelling aspect of the game, full of tension, humor, and drama.</p>

        <p>While the narrative is filled with intriguing twists, the storytelling occasionally falters due to pacing issues and the lack of strong character development for some of the key characters. The plot can feel a bit too predictable at times, especially with certain side stories. That said, the game's many endings give a sense of closure and choice that enhances replayability.</p>

        <h2>Gameplay & Mechanics: 7/10</h2>
        <p>Cyberpunk 2077 presents a first-person open-world RPG with a lot of ambition. The gameplay mechanics include a mix of combat, exploration, and role-playing elements, but the execution isn’t always consistent.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Combat:</strong> The combat system is a blend of shooting, hacking, and melee combat. The gunplay feels satisfying, with a wide variety of weapons that include firearms, explosives, and futuristic tech. The shooting mechanics are fun, but the AI can be a bit inconsistent, especially in more chaotic firefights. Hacking is a unique element, allowing you to take control of cameras, drones, or even enemies, adding a layer of strategy to combat.</li>
            <li><strong>Exploration:</strong> The world of Night City is vast and beautifully detailed, with a variety of districts to explore, each offering its own atmosphere. While the city feels alive, it can also feel empty at times, especially with AI pedestrians that don't always react believably. The driving mechanics are serviceable, though vehicles can feel somewhat stiff compared to other open-world games.</li>
            <li><strong>Choices and Progression:</strong> Cyberpunk 2077 allows you to tailor V’s abilities to suit your playstyle through skill trees and cyberware upgrades. You can focus on combat, hacking, stealth, or a mix of them all. The choices you make in dialogue and story events have significant consequences, but these choices don’t always feel as impactful as advertised. Side quests and world-building are abundant, and many of them add depth to the world of Night City.</li>
            <li><strong>Customization:</strong> V can be highly customized, with a range of appearance options for both character creation and cybernetic enhancements. While the customization is deep, it feels more cosmetic than meaningful in terms of gameplay, as you’re mostly limited to upgrades for performance rather than outward changes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Graphics & Sound: 9/10</h2>
        <p>Visually, Cyberpunk 2077 is a stunner. Night City is breathtakingly designed, with neon lights, towering skyscrapers, and gritty back alleys all contributing to a vibrant, dystopian world. The art direction, especially the futuristic architecture and dystopian landscapes, is impressive, and the lighting is often jaw-dropping, giving the game a truly cinematic look.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Voice Acting:</strong> The voice acting in Cyberpunk 2077 is top-tier, with an all-star cast, including **Keanu Reeves**, **Glenne Headly**, and **Travis Willingham**. Johnny Silverhand's character stands out with its sarcastic, rebellious attitude, making every interaction with him memorable.</li>
            <li><strong>Soundtrack:</strong> The game’s soundtrack is a blend of cyberpunk and synthwave, with artists like **Grimes** and **A$AP Rocky** contributing tracks. The music fits perfectly with the atmosphere of Night City, complementing the futuristic vibe and immersing players in the environment. The sound design in combat and exploration also adds to the immersion, making the world feel alive.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Bugs & Performance: 6/10</h2>
        <p>Upon release, Cyberpunk 2077 was infamously plagued with technical issues and bugs. While many of these problems have been addressed through patches and updates, issues still remain, especially on older consoles and lower-end PCs.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Performance:</strong> On high-end PCs and next-gen consoles, the game runs relatively well, though some visual glitches and frame rate drops can still occur. The older consoles (PS4 and Xbox One) continue to suffer from performance issues like frame rate dips and long load times. Despite patches, the game still has its fair share of hiccups.</li>
            <li><strong>Glitches:</strong> Bugs ranging from minor visual glitches to more serious issues like quest-breaking bugs and NPC behavior problems are still prevalent in some areas. These issues can be frustrating, especially when they hinder progress in the story or make the world feel less immersive.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Replayability & Content: 8/10</h2>
        <p>Cyberpunk 2077 is packed with content. Beyond the main story, there are numerous side quests, gigs, and random encounters to keep players busy. The world of Night City feels expansive, and the game's **lived-in world** is full of small details that make it feel real.</p>

        <p>While the game offers multiple endings based on your choices, the lack of substantial character interactions or branching storylines means that replayability can feel limited for some players. Nonetheless, the game's world-building and wealth of content ensure that there’s plenty to do, and each playthrough can feel different depending on your choices.</p>

        <h2>Final Thoughts: 7.5/10</h2>
        <p>Cyberpunk 2077 had the potential to be a groundbreaking RPG, but technical issues, bugs, and some underwhelming design choices hold it back from being truly exceptional. While the world of Night City is incredibly immersive and the narrative has moments of brilliance, the game falters in some key areas, particularly in its performance and lack of real player choice.</p>

        <h3>Pros:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Breathtaking world design with stunning visuals and atmosphere.</li>
            <li>Engaging main story with deep characters and meaningful choices.</li>
            <li>Excellent voice acting and an immersive soundtrack.</li>
            <li>Plenty of content, including side quests and exploration.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Cons:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Numerous bugs and performance issues, especially on older platforms.</li>
            <li>Somewhat shallow character customization in terms of gameplay impact.</li>
            <li>Inconsistent AI and lack of truly impactful choices.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Verdict:</h3>
        <p>Cyberpunk 2077 offers a thrilling ride through a futuristic world that’s beautifully designed but held back by bugs and technical issues. It’s a game with incredible potential, but it’s one that still needs work to truly realize that potential. If you’re willing to overlook some of its flaws, it’s worth playing for its immersive world and deep narrative.</p>
